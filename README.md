Design Philosophies:

  - Subdomains hosting separate works
  - 'www' and naked subdomains host information about the content creator
  - CMS used to create content between works and meta in WYSIWYG interface
  - Combines work and life of a creator into 1 system

Design Wishes

  - Free-form Template hosting model. You give us a HTML doc (whatever the heck
    it looks like - game, e book, poetry, film) and we'll host it. We'll also
    let you feed work meta-data into other sections of the site
  - Distributed document curation:
    - Allow exports of static data to other hosts.
    - Collaboratively edit documents with other users
    - Share documents with other users and review changes
  - Version control:
    - All documents are versioned in a distributed way where authors can fork
      each other's works and prepare their version of content
